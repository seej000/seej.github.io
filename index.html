            <h2>Week 2</h2>
            <p>
                I learned the basics of Go syntax last week. I have watched about half of the Japanese course videos on Udemy. 
                Since I have studied Python and C++ in the CSPB program, I don't find learning a new language to be particularly challenging, and 
                I expect to finish watching the videos by this weekend. During this foundational study, 
                I learned that an important feature of Go is its proficiency in concurrent processing, specifically realized through goroutines and channels. 
                A few days ago, I was planning to implement a user authentication feature in Go, which is commonly used in backend development, by myself. 
                However, I am now more interested in exploring the mechanism of concurrency itself. I might like theory just as much as I like applications! 
                So, I am considering how best to pursue this exploration. Next week will likely mainly involve finalizing the theme. 
                I will browse through a O'Reilly book 'Concurrency in Go' at a bookstore at first.

            <h2>Week 3</h2>
            <p>
                Last week, I completed learning the basics of Go's syntax. I tried reading an O'Reilly book and realized that concurrent processing is extremely challenging 
                and requires a step-by-step approach. The code doesn't flow in a simple top-down chronological order. 
                It became clear that mastering many new concepts is necessary for concurrency. Furthermore, I have set up a plan for the upcoming weeks. 
                I plan to spend a lot of time on understanding the basics of concurrency. 
                Additionally, I received advice from Dr. Knox yesterday, so I have updated my plan accordingly, which I have included below. 
                This plan was also incorporated into my project proposal. This week, according to the plan, I will be working on expressing the basic concurrent components of Go 
                through words and diagrams. There are no specific obstacles as of now. It is difficult, but I will dedicate time to tackle. 
                Regarding the process, last week was overly busy with other courses, so I couldn't spend as much time as I had anticipated over the weekend. 
                I will create a more rigorous plan at the beginning of this week.

            <h2>Week 4</h2>
            <p>
                Last week, I learned the basic concepts of concurrency in Go. At first, they look impossible to understand, but now I'm beginning to understand the mechanisms of concurrency 
                and the necessity of specific keywords and packages to implement it, and I feel my own growth. I also had some spare time, so I completed the work for next week as well. 
                Given this week's progress, it seems possible to delve deeper into concurrency and related fields than initially planned. 
                Continuing learning with concurrency alone until the beginning of May might be too little. I'm also interested in parallelism, which is often discussed together 
                with concurrency, and High-Performance Computing, which encompasses both.
                While it's not an impediment, for further exploration, I've checked other universities' curriculum and new online materials. 
                I learned that the "CS3211 Parallel and Concurrent Programming" course at the National University of Singapore teaches the concepts of concurrency not only in Go 
                but also in C++ and Rust. I also discovered the existence of Classical Synchronization Problems, including issues such as Dining Philosophers. 
                I found out about Concurrent Data Structures, which are thread-safe data structures. 
                Last but not least, CU Boulder offers an introduction to High-Performance Computing on Coursera, which I might try next week! (https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-high-performance-computing) 
                As for last week's improvement, I should have had a clear focus on the tasks for that week. Adjacent areas always seem interesting, and it's easy to get distracted, 
                so first, I aim to complete the work set for the week.

            <h2>Week 5</h2>
            <p>
                I had already completed the work originally scheduled for last week the week before, so this week I decided to look for and study a new course on concurrency. 
                I enrolled in "Introduction to High-Performance and Parallel Computing" offered by CU Boulder on Coursera and watched the lectures. 
                I learned that HPC primarily refers to supercomputers and was able to grasp the concept of parallel processing. 
                I also found a course on Udemy titled "Modern C++ Concurrency in Depth (C++ 17/20) (udemy.com/course/modern-cpp-concurrency-in-depth)" and started watching it. 
                I feel that concurrency in C++ is much more challenging than in Go. I have come to realize that there is so much more I need to learn.
                My goal for this week is to finish the latter half of "Modern C++ Concurrency in Depth (C++ 17/20)." 
                Additionally, I plan to create a document summarizing design patterns such as Fan-In/Fan-Out.
                Currently, I am not facing any particular problems, nor is there anything that requires significant improvement.

            <h2>Week 6</h2>
            <p>
                I Last week, I learned about concurrency patterns in Go, such as Fan-In, Fan-Out, Pipeline, Heartbeat, etc. 
                While the individual components of Go's concurrency were simple and easy to understand, combining them into patterns was straightforward conceptually 
                but a bit complex and challenging in implementation. However, Go still allows for relatively easy implementation of concurrency. Go is well-suited for industry use. 
                Nevertheless, for studying or researching concurrency itself, system programming languages like C++ or Rust seem more appropriate. 
                A search on Google Scholar revealed that concurrency is much more extensively researched in C++ and Rust than in Go. When I had some extra time last week, 
                I delved into concurrency with C++, the basics of Rust, and practical parallelism using CUDA.
                    1) The C++ course (udemy.com/course/modern-cpp-concurrency-in-depth) became very challenging towards the end, and I had to give up. 
                        I hope to return to it someday.
                    2) The basics of Rust (udemy.com/course/rust-os-system) allowed me to understand the concept of ownership, 
                        though I have not yet reached the discussions on concurrency or parallelism.
                    3) Practical parallelism using CUDA (udemy.com/course/python-cuda) is just right in terms of difficulty. 
                        It involves using CUDA with Python. Google Colab, a Jupyter notebook-like environment, allows for free GPU usage. 
                        It's interesting, so I want to finish it by the end of this week.
                There are no significant impediments or points for improvement. While thinking of time constraints, I will continue exploring related fields this week.
