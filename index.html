            <h2>Week 2</h2>
            <p>
                I learned the basics of Go syntax last week. I have watched about half of the Japanese course videos on Udemy. 
                Since I have studied Python and C++ in the CSPB program, I don't find learning a new language to be particularly challenging, and 
                I expect to finish watching the videos by this weekend. During this foundational study, 
                I learned that an important feature of Go is its proficiency in concurrent processing, specifically realized through goroutines and channels. 
                A few days ago, I was planning to implement a user authentication feature in Go, which is commonly used in backend development, by myself. 
                However, I am now more interested in exploring the mechanism of concurrency itself. I might like theory just as much as I like applications! 
                So, I am considering how best to pursue this exploration. Next week will likely mainly involve finalizing the theme. 
                I will browse through a O'Reilly book 'Concurrency in Go' at a bookstore at first.

            <h2>Week 3</h2>
            <p>
                Last week, I completed learning the basics of Go's syntax. I tried reading an O'Reilly book and realized that concurrent processing is extremely challenging 
                and requires a step-by-step approach. The code doesn't flow in a simple top-down chronological order. 
                It became clear that mastering many new concepts is necessary for concurrency. Furthermore, I have set up a plan for the upcoming weeks. 
                I plan to spend a lot of time on understanding the basics of concurrency. 
                Additionally, I received advice from Dr. Knox yesterday, so I have updated my plan accordingly, which I have included below. 
                This plan was also incorporated into my project proposal. This week, according to the plan, I will be working on expressing the basic concurrent components of Go 
                through words and diagrams. There are no specific obstacles as of now. It is difficult, but I will dedicate time to tackle. 
                Regarding the process, last week was overly busy with other courses, so I couldn't spend as much time as I had anticipated over the weekend. 
                I will create a more rigorous plan at the beginning of this week.

            <h2>Week 4</h2>
            <p>
                Last week, I learned the basic concepts of concurrency in Go. At first, they look impossible to understand, but now I'm beginning to understand the mechanisms of concurrency 
                and the necessity of specific keywords and packages to implement it, and I feel my own growth. I also had some spare time, so I completed the work for next week as well. 
                Given this week's progress, it seems possible to delve deeper into concurrency and related fields than initially planned. 
                Continuing learning with concurrency alone until the beginning of May might be too little. I'm also interested in parallelism, which is often discussed together 
                with concurrency, and High-Performance Computing, which encompasses both.
                While it's not an impediment, for further exploration, I've checked other universities' curriculum and new online materials. 
                I learned that the "CS3211 Parallel and Concurrent Programming" course at the National University of Singapore teaches the concepts of concurrency not only in Go 
                but also in C++ and Rust. I also discovered the existence of Classical Synchronization Problems, including issues such as Dining Philosophers. 
                I found out about Concurrent Data Structures, which are thread-safe data structures. 
                Last but not least, CU Boulder offers an introduction to High-Performance Computing on Coursera, which I might try next week! (https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-high-performance-computing) 
                As for last week's improvement, I should have had a clear focus on the tasks for that week. Adjacent areas always seem interesting, and it's easy to get distracted, 
                so first, I aim to complete the work set for the week.
